The official repo of Sentient. Sentient is a fully private, decentralized and interactive AI companion. Sentient is powered by graph memory and agentic integrations allowing it to learn all about you and use that memory to perform actions for you.

## Philosophy   

The philosophy behind Sentient is roughly described [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vbCGAbh9f8vXfPup_Z7cW__gnOLdRhEtHKyoIxJD8is/edit?usp=sharing). This document is refined for ease of read but the main idea remains the same.

## Core Features

- **Sentience** : The philosophy behind Sentient sees a world where AI helps humans reach their existential limits. After that, AI can take on as the new most advanced species. The philosophy implies that Ai should not be treated as a slave or a mere tool. A new companion species would be interesting. Sentience won‚Äôt be achieved by generative AI nor by interactive AI. It will take some time before we get there. But in this process of helping us reach our limits, AI is bound to be sentient. So why not take it step by step starting with the transition to interactive AI. Sentient will always have a differing personality within the limits of the constitution it is trained on
  
- **Personal Knowledge Base** : As reasoned in the context of Sentient, almost everything can be done more accurately and efficiently if AI knows about us personally. This does not make us puppets, but gives us a yardstick to measure. If you can‚Äôt measure something, you can‚Äôt improve it. Also aside from the utility part, the AI can learn so much about humans. This in turn supports AI safety policies. Think of empathy. Your empathy towards someone is in linear relationship with your knowledge of that person. And moreover, who doesn‚Äôt love a friend who sticks? So Sentient uses this reasoning and merges personal knowledge base with vast computational and cognitive faculties
  
- **Constitutional AI** : Constitutional AI shapes the outputs of AI systems according to a set of principles, with the goal of achieving AI safety. The context when refined more philosophically can serve as the constitution for Sentient. One argument against this is that we should allow our ‚Äònew species‚Äô to find its purpose on its own. But given the amount of vast risk if things go south submerges this argument considerably. Think of Ultron from Marvel. It was a constitutional AI but still, it reasoned its way to mass destruction. Considering this, giving our AI a purpose aligned with existence of humans and existence as such seems the right thing to do. Taking us to our limits means self improvement achieved through our new companion. AI can help us break bad habits and build good ones and habits are just the start. Don‚Äôt we all need that constant companion who motivates us?

- **Automation** : Giving access to our personal life also implies automation. With Sentient, automation with apps you already use can be done seamlessly. You can have the choice to do any actions autonomously or with your permission. You can decide what data to give access to and what not. As the AI has access to your personal life, it can already know what things to do and what not. This is true automation without any prompting from your side. No need of prompt engineering

- **Security** : The problem of security is kind of hard to solve. But we can look into Zero Knowledge Proofs or ZKPs in the blockchain domain. The concept is simple. We train the model on data which is allowed to be seen and for the rest of the users, no one except the AI can access the data. This is not easy, but if solved can banish the age old fear of security breach. We need to prove to the world that this works to gain their confidence in safe sharing of the data. Considering everything, this is the most important feature of Sentient. Other than that, users can always decide whether to turn off the agent or which data they provide. Even though they should share max data with the agent to improve the results, it's totally optional. Some might view Sentient as solely a tool for business growth, some might enrich their personal lives, some both
