Welcome to **Sentient**, your fully personalized, privacy-first AI designed to integrate seamlessly into your daily life. Sentient is more than just a chatbot—it's a context-aware, agentic AI that understands you, your preferences, and your needs, all while ensuring complete data privacy by running entirely on your local device.

This is the **official** releases repository for Sentient that we use to release the latest version of the app to our users.

## Philosophy   

With Sentient, we aim to offer a human-like interaction experience, learning from your behaviors, preferences, and interactions over time. With robust integrations into popular tools like Google Calendar, Gmail, and Google Slides, Sentient can perform complex tasks on your behalf. Whether it's scheduling meetings, drafting emails, or creating presentations, Sentient handles it all with precision and efficiency.

## Core Features

- **Fully Local Data and Inference**: All your data stays on your device. Sentient performs AI inference locally, ensuring your privacy is never compromised.
- **Personal Context**: Integrate your personality test results and social media profiles to give Sentient deeper insights into your preferences and behaviors.
- **Agentic Abilities**: Sentient can interact with GSuite tools to automate tasks such as creating calendar events, sending emails, drafting documents, and more.
- **Memories**: Sentient remembers important facts about you, using them to tailor responses and provide a truly personalized experience.
- **Internet Search**: Need extra information? Sentient can search the web to provide comprehensive, up-to-date responses.

## Upcoming Features 

- **Enhanced Stability**: Improvements to model inference for more structured outputs, better error handling, and increased reliability.
- **Dual Memory System**: A combination of short-term memory (for reminders and temporary data) and long-term memory (persisted in a knowledge graph).
- **Intent Recognition**: Sentient will autonomously act on triggers from short-term memory.
- **Tool-Specific UI**: Integrated UIs for tools like Gmail, allowing inbox management directly within Sentient.
- **Advanced Internet Search**: More comprehensive search results, including images, citations, and direct source links.
- **Expanded Tool Integrations**: Based on user requests, upcoming integrations include Notion, LinkedIn, GitHub, and WhatsApp.
- **Voice Interaction**: Engage with Sentient using natural voice commands.
- **Browser Control**: Sentient will interact with websites to perform tasks on your behalf.
- **OS-Level Integration**: Share your screen to provide real-time context, enhancing Sentient's assistance capabilities.
